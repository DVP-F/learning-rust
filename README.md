# Learning Rust  

This is gonna be based on [W3Schools' tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/rust/rust_getstarted.php) and a list of projects you can find in [./projects/pre-planned/project-list.txt](./projects/pre-planned/project-list.txt)  

This list was generated with Qwen's [Qwen3-235B-A22B](https://huggingface.co/chat/models/Qwen/Qwen3-235B-A22B) on [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/)  

## Sorting  

Everything from the tutorial will be filed under [./tutorial/](./tutorial/) as relevantly named folders  

Everything from the project list will be filed under [./projects/pre-planned/](./projects/pre-planned/)  

Other wacky stuff will be filed under [./projects/wackadoodledee/](./projects/wackadoodledee/)  

Parts of the tutorial may be dumped to .md files in relevant folders with links to the exact part of the tutorial they come from
