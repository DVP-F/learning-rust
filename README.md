# Learning Rust  

This is gonna be based on [W3Schools' tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/rust/rust_getstarted.php) and a list of projects you can find in [project-list.txt]  

This list was generated with Qwen's Qwen3-235B-A22B on [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/)  

## Sorting  

Everything from the tutorial will be filed under ./tutorial/  

Everything from the project list will be filed under ./projects/pre-planned/  

Other wacky stuff will be filed under ./projects/wackadoodledee/
